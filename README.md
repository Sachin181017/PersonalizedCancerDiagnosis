This repository contains a Jupyter Notebook that demonstrates a personalized approach to cancer diagnosis using machine learning techniques. 
The notebook includes:
Data Preprocessing: Methods for cleaning and preparing cancer-related data for analysis.
Feature Engineering: Techniques to extract meaningful features from raw data, improving model accuracy.
Modeling: Implementation of various machine learning algorithms to predict cancer diagnoses.
Visualization: Graphs and plots to visualize the data, model performance, and decision-making processes.
Evaluation: Comprehensive evaluation metrics to assess the model's accuracy and reliability.

This project aims to provide a foundation for researchers and data scientists to explore personalized medicine in oncology, with a focus on developing models that can assist in accurate and personalized cancer diagnosis.
